In this project when you run the program, you will see a square. When you press "x"
it will rotate around x-axis and same process for "y" and "z buttons". You can
choose multiple coordinates.
	eg. You can press x y and z then it will be rotating around x,y and z. 
If you press x again, it will stop rotating around x. Same if you press y and z.

Also you can press "f" to make it faster or "s" to slower. 

press "p" for pause.

If you click any face it will be grey.
